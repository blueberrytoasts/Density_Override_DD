# Complete Repository Replacement

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This is a complete replacement, not a merge** ⚠️

This pull request completely replaces all existing repository content with a new, cleaned-up version of the DO DD-scripts project.

## What this PR does:
- **Replaces ALL existing files** with the new implementation
- **Removes ALL previous history** and starts fresh
- **Consolidates scattered code** into a unified structure
- **Eliminates redundant files** and deprecated functionality

## Why a complete replacement:
- Previous repository had accumulated significant technical debt
- Multiple versions of similar functionality existed
- Documentation was scattered and outdated
- File structure was inconsistent and confusing
- Many unused/broken files were cluttering the repository

## New Repository Structure:
```

```

## Key Improvements:
✅ **Fixed critical bugs**:
- Bone classification threshold corrected (150→400 HU)
- Bright artifact tissue/bone labels fixed
- Import errors resolved
- ROI positioning accuracy improved

✅ **Streamlined functionality**:
- Reduced from 5 to 3 essential segmentation methods
- Unified metal detection interface
- Context-aware artifact detection for low HU artifacts

✅ **Enhanced visualization**:
- High-contrast colors for better visibility
- Updated HU ranges for 16-bit CT systems
- Clear legend labels with directional arrows

✅ **Cleaned codebase**:
- Removed redundant documentation files
- Eliminated cache files and temporary data
- Consolidated duplicate functionality
- Removed broken test files

## Testing Status:
- [x] Import errors fixed
- [x] Core functionality verified
- [x] Visualization improvements confirmed
- [x] Configuration updates validated

## Deployment:
- Use `./run.sh` to launch the Streamlit application
- Requires Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Tested on Linux systems with Python 3.12

## Breaking Changes:
⚠️ **This completely replaces the existing repository**
- All previous files will be removed
- Previous git history will be lost
- Any external references to old file paths will break
- Custom configurations will need to be re-applied

## Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify the new structure meets project requirements
- [ ] Confirm all necessary functionality is preserved
- [ ] Test the application launches successfully
- [ ] Validate that patient data processing works correctly
- [ ] Ensure export functionality operates as expected
