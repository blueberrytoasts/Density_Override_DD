# Session Summary - 2025-08-16 (Session 1)

## Accomplishments:

1.  **Added 1cm Scale Bar:**
    *   Implemented a 1cm scale bar on the single slice view in the "Single Slice Analysis" tab.
    *   This provides a visual reference for the real-world distances in the CT scan image.

2.  **Scale Bar Adjustments:**
    *   Fixed a `ValueError` that occurred after the initial implementation of the scale bar.
    *   Iteratively adjusted the position and layout of the scale bar and its "1 cm" text label to ensure they are clearly visible and not overlapping.
    *   The final layout places the text below the bar.

3.  **Added Execution Timers:**
    *   Implemented timers for the metal detection and artifact segmentation processes.
    *   The application now displays the time taken for these operations to complete, providing useful performance feedback.

## Files Modified:

*   `app/visualization.py`: Added logic to draw the scale bar and its label.
*   `app/main.py`: Passed the necessary DICOM spacing information to the visualization function and added the timer logic.
